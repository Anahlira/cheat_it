    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, there were two students named Berna and Teodora. They
      were both passionate about learning and constantly seeking ways to improve
      their study habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, they struggled to find a suitable app that allowed them to create
      custom tests and practice their knowledge in an interactive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frustrated with the available options, Berna and Teodora decided to take
      matters into their own hands. They embarked on a journey to build their
      own test app from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      With countless hours of coding, designing, and brainstorming, they created
      an app that fulfilled their needs. It allowed them to create tests with
      personalized questions, set correct answers, and even play the tests in a
      fun and engaging way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Berna and Teodora use their app to study effectively and share their
      knowledge with others. They are proud of their creation and hope that it
      helps many students on their learning journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Join them on this adventure and discover the power of personalized test
      creation and interactive learning!
